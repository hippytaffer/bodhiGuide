        <p>Quick Launcher
            started it’s life as an <strong>E17</strong> module
              called ‘everything’ Since then it has been tweaked and improved,
              but the initial idea of being able to find literally everything
              using a fully-indexed
            database of all the applications and files on your PC remains.</p>
        <p>Other operating
            systems have similar features. Windows has "Desktop Search", Mac OS
            X has "Spotlight" Other Window Managers and Desktop Environments
            have similar tools. What sets <strong>Quick Launcher</strong>
            apart is its plugin architecture that allows it to go beyond simply
            finding applications and files.</p>
        <h2><a name="How to Run Everything"></a>How to Run Everything</h2>
        <p><strong>Quick
                  Launcher</strong> is
            quite sophisticated. Not only because of what
            it can do, but how easily you
            can do it. The default method of opening <strong>Quick Launcher </strong>is
            to press <em>Alt+Esc</em>. Then simply start typing what you want to do. As
            you type, <strong>Quick
                  Launcher</strong> will
            start showing suggestions of what it thinks you want to do. When you
            see what you want, you can select it and press <em>Enter</em> or double-click it. If you change your mind and
            want to exit <strong>Quick
                  Launcher</strong>,
            simply press <em>Esc</em> or click somewhere outside the <strong>Quick
                  Launcher</strong>
            window.</p>
        <p>By default, <strong>Bodhi Linux</strong>
            also provides <em>Win+Space</em> as a shortcut to <strong>Everything</strong> and you can also access it from <em>Main
              Menu -&gt; </em><em></em>Quick
                  Launcher</em>. 
        </p>
        <p><img src="../images/Quick-Launcher.jpg" alt="Quick Launcher" /></p>
        <p><strong>Quick Launcher</strong> also
            adapts to your computing habits. Every time you use it keeps track
            of what you do most frequently. Over time your more commonly used
            files, applications, etc. appear with fewer keystrokes. For example,
            when you first use <strong>Quick
                  Launcher</strong> and
            simply enter the letter <code>L</code> , you will see several applications in some order
            such as <strong>Leafpad</strong>, <strong>Libreoffice</strong>, <strong>Libremath</strong>, and so on. Now suppose you kept going and typed <code>Livepatch</code>, and launched it. After doing this a few times, you
            will only have to type <code>L</code> and <strong>Livepatch</strong> will show first.</p>
        <h3>It Doesn’t Stop There </h3>
        <p>Suppose you have
            a custom bash script called <code>myscript.sh</code> , and you want to edit it. You fire up <strong>Quick
                  Launcher</strong> and
            type <code>myscript.sh</code> . Now when you select it, how is <strong>Quick
                  Launcher </strong>supposed
            to know whether you want to edit it or run it?</p>
        <p>If you look at
            the top of the <strong>Quick
                  Launcher </strong>window,
            you will see two tabs. The first one is the default view that lists
            the possible matches to your query. The second one is contextual and
            can change depending on what is selected. It typically shows the
            various <em>Actions</em>
            you can perform with the selected item.</p>
        <p>Back to our <code>myscript.sh</code>
            example, if you click on the second tab, you will see a list of
            possible things you can do with your script such as <em>Open with...</em> or
          <em>Copy to..</em>.
            It might also list a text editor like <em>Leafpad</em> and an option to <em>Run
              in Terminal</em>. Choose <em>Leafpad</em> and your
            script will open for editing.</p>
        <p>The icing on the
            cake is that just as <strong>Quick
                  Launcher </strong>keeps
            track of what you select most frequently, it also remembers what you
            do with them most frequently. So next time, you type <code>myscript.sh</code>
            into <strong>Quick
                  Launcher </strong>the
            first <em>Action</em>
            it chooses will likely be to open it in <strong>Leafpad</strong>.</p>
        <h2><a name="Plugins"></a>
          Plugins</h2>
        <p>As mentioned
            before, one of <strong>Quick
                  Launcher’s </strong>most
            powerful features is its plugin architecture. Everything you see in
            it is the result of some plugin. The more commonly used and
            understood ones are <strong>Applications</strong>, <strong>Files</strong>, and <strong>Recent
              Files</strong>. If you open <strong>Everything Settings</strong>
            at <em>Main Menu -&gt; Settings -&gt;
              Settings Panel -&gt; Launcher -&gt; Everything Configuration</em>, and choose the <em>Plugins</em> tab, you will see that there are three types of
            plugins: <em>Subject, Action, </em>and <em>Object</em>.</p>
        <img src="../images/quick-launcher-config.jpg" alt="Quick Launcher Config" />
        <p>These are
            organized the same as the tabs you see at the top of the <strong>Quick
                  Launcher </strong>window.
            The first tab shows the results from the applicable <em>Subject</em> plugins.
            The second tab shows any applicable <em>Action</em> plugins, things you can do with the selected <em>Subject</em>. If
            needed, there will be a third tab that shows the applicable <em>Object</em> plugins,
          to
              perform the selected <em>Action</em> on. (For
            example, if you select the <em>Copy
              To...</em> <em>Action</em>, it needs to know where to copy to.) The smaller
            text in the upper right corner of each tab shows what plugin is
            generating the current result.</p>
        Along the bottom of the <strong>Quick
                Launcher </strong>window
          you can see more tabs showing the available plugins for each type: <em>Subject, Action,</em>
          or <em>Object</em>.
          They are also contextual based on what is currently selected. By
          default, every option from every plugin is shown. The tabs listed at
          the bottom allow you to filter the choices by plugin.</p>

        <h3>As an application launcher </h3>
        <p>In the screenshot
            above, the user has "raised" Everything by entering the <em>key binding</em>
            (keyboard shortcut) <strong>Alt+Esc</strong> or <strong>Win+Space</strong>. Next, the user entered "E". Just entering "E"
            causes <strong>Quick
                  Launcher </strong>to
            search its history-sorted database for the most frequently-used
            applications starting with that letter. It finds several, the first
            nine of which are displayed with their icons in a grid. But, if the
            user follows the "E" with a "v", so the command line at the upper
            left contains "Ev" - the scope of possibilities reduces, so the most
            probable intended application becomes "Everything Configuration",
            which is highlighted. Once an application is highlighted, it can be
            launched simply by double-clicking the icon or by pressing the
            Return key. Try it!</p>
        <h2><a name="Beyond Everything"></a> Beyond
            Everything</h2>
        <p>The above plugins
            are the standard ones that come with <strong>Everything</strong>. You can install additional plugins to enhance the
            functionality of <strong>Everything</strong>. Below are a few examples.</p>
        <h3>Calculator
           </h3>
        <p>The calculator
            plugin allows <strong>Quick
                  Launcher </strong>to
            perform the basic functions of a calculator. You will likely see the
            plugin is already installed. Press <code>=</code> to trigger the calculator plugin. Type <code>=1+2</code> and you
            will see <code>3</code>
            listed in the <em>Subject</em> tab.</p>

        <p>While you can use
            your mouse to navigate through <strong>Quick
                  Launcher</strong>, it
            was designed with the keyboard jockey in mind. Here are the basics.
