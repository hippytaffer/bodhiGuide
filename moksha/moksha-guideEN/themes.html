        <h1>The Bodhi Guide to Moksha<br>
            Themes</h1>
        <p>Most new users often don’t realise that<strong> Moksha</strong>
            prides it’s self on providing the user with a lot of control when it
            comes to configuring their desktop, and has many themes available in
            the Bodhi repo. It is quite common for <strong>Moksha</strong> users to spend hours tweaking different settings to
            get it just right. Some of these users move on to actual theming,
            which is a whole world of it’s own and there is no scope here to
            cover it, but have been kind enough to share their hard work by
            sharing themes that they have creating.  </p>
        <p><strong>Themes</strong> provide a way to package together all the different
            options that alter the look of your desktop. This can include
            everything from the background to the <strong>Clock</strong> <a href="gadgets.html">Gadget</a>, to the boarder
            color and everything in between.  </p>

          Switching Themes</h2>
        <p>To see what
            themes are installed go to <i>Main
              Menu →Settings → Theme. </i>The standard
                Bodhi iso, at the time of writing come with two themes by
                default. Arc Green and Arc Dark. To install more themes, you can
                use synaptic to search and select themes to install, or using
                apt on the command line.<br>

        <p>To bring up the<strong> Theme Selector</strong> to
              preview themes and other things
            go to<em> Main Menu -&gt; Settings
              -&gt; Settings Panel -&gt; Look -&gt; Theme</em>.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img
              src="../images/theme2.jpg" name="Image1" style="width: 643px; height: 346px;"
              border="0" align="bottom">  </p>
        <p>The list on the
            left shows all the available <strong>Themes</strong>. Clicking on one will show a preview of the <strong>Theme</strong>
            background on the right. When you find a <strong>Theme</strong> you like, select it from the list and click <em>OK</em> or <em>Apply</em>. The
            changes will usually take place immediately. If they don't, try
            restarting <strong>Moksha</strong> (<em>Main Menu -&gt;
              About Operating System -&gt; Restart Moksha</em>).
             </p>
        <p>You might be
            wondering what the options <em>Personal</em> and <em>System</em> in the top left of the dialog mean. This simply
            indicates in what directory the <strong>Theme
              Selector </strong>is looking for <strong>Themes</strong>. The
          <em>System</em>
            option tells it to look in <code>/usr/share/enlightenment/data/themes/</code>. The <em>Personal</em> option points to <code>~/.e/e/themes/</code>. If you are the creative type and want to create
            your own <strong>Theme</strong>, you can save it here (See <strong><a href="creating_themes.html">Creating Themes</a></strong>).
            Also, please consider sharing it with the rest of the <strong>Bodhi Linux</strong>
            community.</p>

        <h2><a name="Advanced Themes"></a>
          Advanced Themes</h2>
        <p>By now, you
            probably have tried out several different <strong>Themes</strong>. It's likely that you have found things to like and
            dislike about several of them, and perhaps you wish you could use
            the <strong>Menu</strong> from one <strong>Theme</strong> along with the <strong>Clock</strong> style of another. As mentioned before, the user is
            in control of their desktop, and the <strong>Theme
              Selector</strong> makes it very easy
            to mix and match different elements from different <strong>Themes</strong>. 
        </p>
        <p>Open the <strong>Theme Selector</strong>
            and click on the <em>Advanced</em> button in the bottom right corner. The dialog will
            expand into three sections.  </p>
        <p align="center"><br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p>The first section
            on the left, <strong>Theme Categories</strong>, shows all the different options that can be
            controlled by <strong>Themes</strong>. The middle section, <strong>Themes</strong>, shows all the available <strong>Themes</strong> on your computer. The right most section, <strong>Preview</strong>, is
            a preview window like the one in the Basic view.  </p>
        <p>In <strong>Theme Categories</strong>,
            all the options with a <em>check</em> next to them have an assigned <strong>Theme</strong>. In
            the <strong>Themes</strong> section, all <strong>Themes</strong> with the <em>paintbrush
              and colors icon</em> are <strong>Themes</strong> that
            have been assigned to at least one category.  </p>
        <h3><a name="Assigning Themes"></a>
          Assign Themes</h3>
        <p>To assign a theme
            to a category, select the category in the <strong>Theme
              Categories</strong> section. Then
            select the desired <strong>Theme</strong> from the <strong>Themes</strong> section, and click the <em>Assign</em> button near the bottom left corner.  </p>
        <p>For example, say
            you like most of the <em>vice-versa</em> <strong>Theme</strong>, except you would prefer to use the <strong>Start</strong> button
            from <em>moonlight</em>.
            Open the Advanced <strong>Theme
              Selector</strong> dialog, select the
          <em>modules/start</em>
            category under <strong>Theme
              Categories</strong>, select the <em><i>Vice-versa
                  </i></em>theme under <strong>Themes</strong>, and
            click <em>Assign</em>.
            You will notice that an icon displays next to the newly assigned
            category. This indicates the category's <strong>Theme</strong> has been changed. Changes will not take effect
            until you click <em>OK</em> or <em>Apply</em> at the bottom of the dialog. You can make
            assignments to as many categories as you want, and when you are
            ready, <em>Apply</em>
            all the changes at once. Using our example, if you go back and look
            at the <em>modules/start</em> category you should see a <em>check</em> next to it indicating that this category is
            assigned a <strong>Theme</strong>. Selecting the category will show you what <strong>Theme</strong> is
            assigned by automatically selecting it in the <strong>Themes</strong>
            section.  </p>
        <h3><a name="Removing Themes"></a>
          Remove Themes</h3>
        <p>If you want to
            remove an assigned <strong>Theme</strong> from a category, select the category and click <em>Clear</em>.
            Alternatively, you can remove all <strong>Themes</strong> by clicking <em>Clear
              All</em>. Then click <em>OK</em> or <em>Apply</em> to remove
            the assignment.  </p>
        <h3><a name="Base Theme"></a>
          Base Theme</h3>
        <p>One special
            category of note is the <em>Base Theme</em> category. If a <strong>Theme</strong> is assigned to <em>Base
              Theme</em>, it will apply to all
            categories defined in the <strong>Theme</strong>.The Basic view of the <strong>Theme
              Selector</strong> is actually a
            streamlined interface for assigning this category.  </p>
        <p>No <em>check marks</em> will
            show next to affected categories to indicate they are customized, as
            the result of assigning the <em>Base
              Theme</em>. This is because assigning
            a <strong>Theme</strong>
            to any of the other categories will override any customizations from
            the <em>Base Theme</em>.
           </p>
        <p>Any category
            without a <strong>Theme</strong> assigned (either directly assigned or from the <em>Base Theme</em>) will
            use the <em>default</em>
            theme.  </p>
        <h3><a name="Saving Themes"></a>
          Saving Themes</h3>
        <p>Now perhaps, you
            have spent several hours creating a custom <strong>Theme</strong> by mixing up themes from the Advanced <strong>Theme Selector</strong>.
            You want to try a new look, but not lose your current <strong>Theme</strong>. At
            this point, you are probably looking for the <em>Save</em> button, but you won't find it because it does not
            exist. To get around this, we can use <strong>Profiles</strong>. (Further information in the <a href="profiles.html">Profiles
              section.</a>)  </p>
        <p>During your first
            boot of <strong>Bodhi</strong>, you may have been asked to select a <strong>Profile</strong>
            (Bare, Desktop, Fancy, etc.). Or you may have been assigned a
            default profile. All the changes you have made to your current theme
            are now a part of that <strong>Profile</strong>.  </p>
        <p>To open the <strong>Profile</strong>
            dialog, go to <em>Main Menu -&gt;
              Settings -&gt; Settings Panel -&gt; Settings -&gt; Profiles</em>. This will open the <strong>Profile
              Selector</strong>.  </p>
        <p align="center"><img
              src="../images/profiles.jpg" name="Image3" style="width: 540px; height: 273px;"
              border="0" align="bottom">  </p>
        <p>Your current <strong>Profile</strong> will
            be selected. Click the <em>Add</em> button at the bottom, and enter a name into the <strong>Add New Profile</strong>
            dialog that pops up. Click <em>OK</em>, and your new <strong>Profile</strong> will be added to the list of available profiles.
            Your new <strong>Profile</strong> is initially a duplicate of your current <strong>Profile</strong>. 
        </p>
        <p>Select the new <strong>Profile</strong> and
            click <em>OK</em>
            or <em>Apply</em>.
          <strong>E17</strong>
            will restart, and you will see the same desktop that you saw before
            (this is expected because it is a duplicate of your other <strong>Profile</strong>).
            Now make some changes to your theme and/or layout of your desktop.
            Go back to the <strong>Profile
              Selector</strong>, and change back to
            your old <strong>Profile</strong>. You should see your previous <strong>Theme</strong> and
            layout.  </p>
        <h3><a name="Creating Themes"></a>
          Creating Themes</h3>
        <p>The above method
            of using <strong>Profiles</strong> is a quick hack and not the way
              to make an actual <strong>Theme</strong>. As
            mentioned above, this topic is beyond the scope of this document. To
            find out more ask on our forums or on our discord channel.</p>
        <h2><a name="Changing Just the Background"></a>
          Change Just the Background</h2>
        <p>If you're
            interested in changing just the background (wallpaper), here's how.
            Go to <em>Main Menu -&gt; Settings
              -&gt; Settings Panel -&gt; Look -&gt; Wallpaper</em>.
            Uncheck the <em>Use Theme Wallpaper</em> option, and select the background you want. You may
            need to import the picture if you do not see it initially. Use the <em>Picture</em> dialog
            to do this.  </p>
