            is Bodhi Linux</font></h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.53cm"><font color="#000000">Bodhi Linux, in
            short, is <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu LTS</a> (currently
            22.04) using Moksha Window Manager, a fork of <a href="https://www.enlightenment.org/">Enlightenment
              E17</a>. Bodhi was originally developed by, <a href="https://www.jeffhoogland.com/">Jeff
              Hoogland</a>, but is now headed by lead developer Robert (Ylee)
            Wiley, with developer and Moksha guru Stefan (The Waiter) Umram. The
            team is </font><font color="#000000">continuing to </font><font color="#000000">grow,
            as is the wider community. </font><font color="#000000"></font><font
            color="#000000">Recently established Web-Dev Team headed by Eran
            Gelo and Codernic, and with a newly re-established responsive and
            welcoming forum and discord channel. The Bodhi community is known
            for being friendly and welcoming.</font></p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0.53cm">What
            is a Window Manager</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.53cm"><font color="#000000">According to <a
              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager">Wikipedia</a>,
            “[a] window manager is system software that controls the placement
            and appearance of windows within a windowing system in a graphical
            user interface … They work in conjunction with the underlying
            graphical system which provides required functionality such as
            support for graphics hardware, pointing devices, and a keyboard, and
            are often written and created using a widget toolkit.”</font></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.53cm"><font color="#000000">In non-technical
            terms, the Window Manager is essentially what the end user sees and
            interacts with, the "GUI" (graphical user interface). Over time,
            many Window Managers have been extended to become full-fledged
            Desktop Environments. A Desktop Environment is generally considered
            to be a Window Manager that integrates common applications and
            services along with the Window Manager. </font> </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.53cm"><font color="#000000">One exciting part
            about Linux, and one of the ways it stands out from other operating
            systems such as Windows and OSX, is that the end user has a plethora
            of choices for how they can interact with their computer. This is
            partly, and perhaps most obviously, done through providing various <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_X_window_managers">Window
              Managers and Desktop Environments for users to choose from</a>. </font>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.53cm"><font color="#000000">By default,
            Ubuntu Linux uses <a href="https://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a>.
            Although great in many ways, Gnome is not known for being extremely
            fast, nor is it suited for older machines as it is large and
            consists of many applications, each with their own long list of
            dependencies. The current LTS release of Ubuntu <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">recommends</a>
            4 GB of RAM and 25 GB of free hard drive space. With this large
            footprint, Ubuntu provides out-of-the-box support for most systems
            including for most graphics cards, sound cards, and even touch
            screens, but also brings many additional applications that may be
            used by some users while never used by others. </font> </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.53cm"><strong><font color="#000000">The goal
              of Bodhi Linux was and continues to be to bring combine the best
              parts of Ubuntu with the more streamlined, flexible, fast, and
              less resource-hungry Window Manager known as "Moksha".</font></strong><font
            color="#000000"> In other words, to bring an elegant Linux
            distribution at a fraction of the resource use of most other
            distributions while sacrificing none of the beauty or core
            functionality of Ubuntu. </font> </p>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0.53cm">What is Moksha Window
          Manager?</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.53cm"><font color="#000000">Moksha Window
            Manager is a fork of Enlightenment version 0.1.7 ("E17"). </font> </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.53cm"><font color="#000000">Bodhi Linux was
            originally built using the </font><strong><font color="#000000">Enlightenment
              Window Manager</font></strong><font color="#000000">. Although
            known as a Window Manager, Enlightenment stradles the line between a
            Window Manager and a Desktop Environment by bringing most of the
            functionality found in much more resource-hungry Desktop
            Environments. </font> </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.53cm"><font color="#000000">The first version
            of </font><strong><font color="#000000">Enlightenment</font></strong><font
            color="#000000"> was released in 1997. In December 2000 it was
            completely re-written using the </font><strong><font color="#000000">Enlightenment
              Foundation Libraries (EFL)</font></strong><font color="#000000">,
            and remains in active development to this day. For years, E17 was
            used as the Window Manager of Bodhi Linux. In 2015, founder and lead
            developer Jeff Hoogland, began a fork of the E17 Window Manager.
            This fork, specifically designed for Bodhi Linux, became known as
            "Moksha" (pronounced “mohk-shuh”). </font><strong><font color="#000000">Moksha
              is Sanskrit in origin just like Bodhi. It means “emancipation,
              liberation, or release”</font></strong><font color="#000000"> </font>

            why Moksha Window Manager was developed can be found here: <a href="http://www.bodhilinux.com/2015/04/28/introducing-the-moksha-desktop/">Introducing

            RAM. That is </font><strong><font color="#000000"><u>far</u></font></strong><font
            color="#000000"> less than most modern Window Managers, not to
            mention complete Desktop Environments. But it doesn't come at the
            expense of great looks or functionality. Enlightenment is one of the
            most elegant Window Managers available, and is highly extensible

            Manager was born with these same ideals in mind, taking the best
            parts of what E17 brought to the table, while fixing, modifying, and
            expanding on what did not quite fit right with the project. The
            Moksha development team upstreams patches where appropriate and will
            always be greatful for the fact that without E17 and its developers,
            Bodhi Linux and the Moksha Window Manager would never have been
            possible. </font> </p>
